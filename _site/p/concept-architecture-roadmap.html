<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p>Metaheuristic is an application which implements (or intended to) a Turing complete machine. The main use of MH is a management of distributed tasks.
Common cases of usage are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Batch processing. <br />
  Common usage of batch processing - split data, create tasks for processing each part of data, 
  process Tasks, aggregate results</li>
  <li>Bulk processing of images.</li>
  <li>Bulk processing of text.</li>
</ul>

<p>All calcualtions are performed by distributed functions.</p>

<p>Metaheuristic can be deployed on-premiceses or in cloud. 
On-premises deployment allows to utilize internal computationa resource in more efficient way, i.e. running tasks at night. 
Also it helps to protect companies’ intellectual property.</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>Metaheuristic has two main modules - Dispatcher and Processor
The purpose of Dispatcher is to manage tasks which will be processed at Processor side.
Processor is a module of Metaheuristic which is responsible for receiving tasks, 
preparing assets, processing task, and delivering results of processing of task to the Dispatcher.</p>

<p>The typical configuration is one Dispatcher and N Processor. Processor could be configured to host 
tasks from unlimited number of Dispatchers. The current algorithm to determine the order of receiving 
tasks from Processors is round-robin.</p>

<p>A processing entity which is configured at Dispatcher and is being run at Processor is a Function.
Function can be executable application, .jar file, python notebook, 
file in any scripting language. It can be ‘curl’ command to request external url, send e-mail and so on. \ 
For full description of Function see <a href="function">documentation on Functions</a></p>

<p>From delivery point of view Function can be provisioned from Dispatcher or from git repository.</p>

<p>For creating set of tasks, Dispatcher is using a dynamic directed acyclic graph (DAG) which defines the order 
in which Processors have to process tasks.</p>

<p>Tasks can have any number of Variables for its execution purpose. 
The most common case for hyper-parameter optimization is when Variables are dataset, model fitting/predicting, metrics.
For full description of Variables see <a href="variable">documentation on Variables</a></p>

<p>Communications between Processors and Dispatcher base on pull mode - Processors constantly start communiccation with Dispatcher. 
Push mode isn’t supported.</p>
