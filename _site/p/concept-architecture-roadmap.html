<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p>Metaheuristic is an application which implements (or intended to) a Turing complete machine. 
The main use of MH is a management of distributed task. Right now there two main areas where MH is being used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>AI model’s hyper-parameter optimization purpose. <br />
 Each optimization is presented as Experiment. An Experiment consists of some Tasks.
 Tasks are created at Dispatcher and distributed to Processor. For evaluating a performance of models, 
 metrics and other data are collected and evaluated later by Metaheuristic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Batch processing. <br />
  Common usage of batch processing - split data, create tasks for processing each part of data, 
  process Tasks, aggregate results</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>Metaheuristic has two main modules - Dispatcher and Processor
The purpose of Dispatcher is to manage tasks which will be processed at Processor side.
Processor is a module of Metaheuristic which is responsible for receiving tasks, 
preparing assets, processing task, and delivering results of processing of task to the Dispatcher.</p>

<p>The typical configuration is one Dispatcher and N Processor. Processor could be configured to host 
tasks from unlimited number of Dispatchers. The current algorithm to determine the order of receiving 
tasks from Processors is round-robin.</p>

<p>A processing entity which is configured at Dispatcher and is being run at Processor is a Function.
Function can be executable application, .jar file, python notebook, 
file in any scripting language. It can be ‘curl’ command to request external url, send e-mail and so on.
Instance of Function is Task. <br />
For full description of Function see <a href="function">documentation on Functions</a></p>

<p>From delivery point of view Function can be provisioned from Dispatcher or from git repository.</p>

<p>For full description how to use Function for hyper-parameter optimization see <a href="experiment">documentation on Experiment</a></p>

<p>For creating set of tasks, Dispatcher is using a dynamic directed acyclic graph which defines the order 
in which Processors have to process tasks.</p>

<p>Tasks can have any number of Variables for its execution purpose. 
The most common case for hyper-parameter optimization is when Variables are dataset, model fitting/predicting, metrics.
For full description of Variables see <a href="variable">documentation on Variables</a></p>

<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Series of Experiments.</li>
  <li>Implementation the different strategies for Series - Genetic algorithm, Bayesian optimization, GRASP, ILS. 
 The concrete algo which will be implemented in first place will be chosen later.</li>
  <li>Prototype 2-side platform for optimization based on Metaheuristic.</li>
  <li>TBD</li>
</ul>
